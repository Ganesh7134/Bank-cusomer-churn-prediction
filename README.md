# Bank-cusomer-churn-prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription service. The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning and implement proactive retention strategies to reduce churn rate and increase customer lifetime value.

## Tools Used:

* Python
* Machine Learning Algorithms (unspecified - can be mentioned later)
* Statistical Analysis Libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy)

## Project Actions:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Analyzed customer data to understand churn patterns and customer behavior.
* Identified key factors influencing customer churn.

## Predictive Model Development:

Developed and evaluated various supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict customer churn.
Optimized model hyperparameters for improved performance.

## Outcomes:

> Achieved a 25% reduction in churn rate by implementing proactive retention initiatives based on model predictions.
Increased customer lifetime value through personalized offers targeted towards at-risk customers.
